# Image-Color-Manipulation
Implementing Image color manipulation operations like linear scaling and histogram equalization.

Description of Files:
1.	proj1-a.py is First Program which displays continuous changes in color for Luv representation.
2.	proj1-b.py is Second program which performs linear scaling in the Luv domain.
3.	proj1-c.py is Third program which performs histogram equalization in the Luv domain.
4.	proj1-d.py is Fourth program which is the same as the third program, except openCV functions for color conversion and histogram equalization.

Inputs to run programs:
For proj1-a.py: python proj1-a.py number_of _columns number_of_rows 

For proj1-b.py, proj1-c.py, proj1-d.py: proj1-n.py w1 h1 w2 h2 input_image name_of_output_image

Where n is b, c, d
